# OctoBounty

### Make money solving GitHub issues.

#### Scope

Octo/Bounty is a platform that encourages developers to engage in open source project to earn money. Open source
software might be freely developed by many talented individuals, but sometimes you cannot
wait to have an issue solved with a repository/library that you need to utilize. Octo/Bounty gives developers and
companies a tool that allows them to reward members of the community for participating in the open source process.

 #### Motivation
 
 There are several issue bounty hunting sites that exist, but they all require users to pay large fees that can
 eat into the profit they worked hard to earn. This site aims to be completely free to use. You earned the money
 hunting the issues, not us.
 
 #### Site Design
 
 The site was designed to be very easy to read and understand. A modern layout, large clear fonts, and a dark UI scheme 
 with bright contrasting colors really helps the app stand out.
